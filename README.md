# Portfolio

365 Days of Daily Commits

A lot of these will focus on games, but the purpose isn't explicitly game dev, the purpose is to get coding and continue coding. To make coding a habit and use the same guilt trip that a program like DuoLingo does to keep you coming back to motivate myself. I want to create, script, modify, contribute, learn, and generally immerse myself more in the coding community and this is step 1.


Day 1 -- Repo initizialized, workspace connected and repo cloned from there. The goal is not necessarily 365 big commits, but A. to build a portfolio outside of my ops work and B. to achieve consistency. This is the only day where a simple readme change will count, although documentation updates of any major significane will count.

Day 2 -- Fighting the battle with pylint not recognizing pygame, otherwise beginning first experiments with pygame, very little else has changed.

Day 3 -- Switched development environments for simplicity. It is easier to pick up things as I understand adjacent concepts rather than trying to force a deep understanding of linting off the bat. Almost all of my coding experience is in the form of scripting, not in the form of software development proper. So as cool as trying to run a VSCode server in docker on my private server sounds, the specifics are a little over my head for now. I have also gotten to the point where I have a fully running game window for pygame and it closes without error. Now the real work begins.

Day 4 -- Slow day for programming, just have to make sure I make a commit today. Added a clock object to first pygame game. 

Day 5 -- Added background surfaces.

Day 6 -- Added basic animation.

Day 7 -- Added rectangles for better animation.

Day 8 -- Experimenting with collisions.

Day 9 -- Learning more about rectangles.

Day 10 -- Added gravity.

Day 11 -- Added collions, a floor, a game over state, and a restart.

Day 12 -- Added score timer.

Day 13 --  Added game over text, start text, and game over image.

Day 14 --  Added second enemy and refactored collion system.

Day 15 -- Added animations.

Day 16 -- Refactored player as sprite class object.

Day 17 -- Added Music.

Day 18 -- Finished Game!

Day 19 -- Initialized new game, making a game in Godot. This will be the second tutorial I am following, looking to jump off the deep end a bit here. The goal is to participate in a game jam in ~6 months or so.

Day 20 -- Added first scene and imported graphics assets.

Day 21 -- Added player, learned more about scenes.

Day 22 -- Added another node/scene.
