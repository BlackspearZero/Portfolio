# Portfolio

Day 1 of 365 daily commits -- Repo initizialized, workspace connected and repo cloned from there. The goal is not necessarily 365 big commits, but A. to build a portfolio outside of my ops work and B. to achieve consistency. This is the only day where a simple readme change will count, although documentation updates of any major significane will count.
