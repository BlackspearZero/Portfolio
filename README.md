# Portfolio

365 Days of Daily Commits


Day 1 -- Repo initizialized, workspace connected and repo cloned from there. The goal is not necessarily 365 big commits, but A. to build a portfolio outside of my ops work and B. to achieve consistency. This is the only day where a simple readme change will count, although documentation updates of any major significane will count.

Day 2 -- Fighting the battle with pylint not recognizing pygame, otherwise beginning first experiments with pygame, very little else has changed.

Day 3 -- Switched development environments for simplicity. It is easier to pick up things as I understand adjacent concepts rather than trying to force a deep understanding of linting off the bat. Almost all of my coding experience is in the form of scripting, not in the form of software development proper. So as cool as trying to run a VSCode server in docker on my private server sounds, the specifics are a little over my head for now. I have also gotten to the point where I have a fully running game window for pygame and it closes without error. Now the real work begins.

Day 4 -- Slow day for programming, just have to make sure I make a commit today. Added a clock object to first pygame game. 

Day 5 -- Added background surfaces.

Day 6 -- Added basic animation.

Day 7 -- Added rectangles for better animation.

Day 8 -- Experimenting with collisions.

Day 9 -- Learning more about rectangles.
